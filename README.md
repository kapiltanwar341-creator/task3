#  Books REST API (Node.js + Express)

A simple **REST API** built with **Node.js** and **Express**, organized using **routes** and **controllers**.  
This API manages a list of books stored **in-memory** (no database required). Ideal for learning CRUD, Express architecture, and building a lightweight backend.

---

## Features

- GET all books  
- GET a single book by ID  
- POST a new book  
- PUT (update) a book by ID  
- DELETE a book by ID  
- Clean Routes + Controllers structure  
- In-memory data store (resets when the server restarts)  
- CORS enabled to allow simple frontend testing
